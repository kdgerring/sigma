Follow the steps below to install Sigma

1.  Install J2SE Java 2 SDK v1.4.1_05 [Windows (all languages, 
including English) version] (downloaded from 
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html).  Other versions may work, but 
we don't guarrantee it.

2.  Install Tomcat v4.0.4 (downloaded from 
http://archive.apache.org/dist/jakarta/tomcat-4/archive/v4.0.4/bin/jakarta-tomcat-4.0.4.exe). 
Other versions may work, but we don't guarrantee it.

3.  Modify the startup script for Tomcat to use a large stack size.  The Tomcat installation
should have added an item "Apache Tomcat 4.0" to your Start->Programs menu.  Beneath that
menu should be an item "Start Tomcat".  Right click on that menu item and select "Properties".
Then modify the "Target" field to add the command line option "-Xmx300M".  For example, 
depending on where you have installed the JDK, the beginning of the command should be similar to:

C:\j2sdk1.4.0_01\bin\java.exe -jar -Xmx300M


4.  Copy the KBs directory from the CD to your Tomcat directory

5.  Copy the vampire directory onto your hard drive.  The inference engine executable is in
\vampire\Vampire_VSWorkspace\vampire\Release\kif.exe

6.  Place <sigma.war> under your Tomcat installation at
    C:\Program Files\Apache Tomcat 4.0\webapps
 
7.  Start up tomcat, and it should expand itself.  Then go to 
<http://localhost:8080/sigma/KBs.jsp> to get started.  That page allows 
you to create a knowledge base and select the KIF files that comprise it.  

8.  Edit C:\Program Files\Apache Tomcat 4.0\KBs\config.txt to have 
the following line read: 

  <preference key="inferenceEngineDir" value="C:\vampire\Vampire_VSWorkspace\vampire\Release"/>

  or wherever you have placed the kif.exe file as a result of step 5 above.  You may also
set this parameter by clicking "Preferences" from the Sigma home page.
 
 
Note that if you want to load a new version of Sigma, you must kill and restart TOMCAT 
as well as deleting the directory C:\Program Files\Apache Tomcat 4.0\webapps/sigma
