# From host

Go where you want to keep your Vagrant installations and make a new dir for your new box, e.g.:

```
mkdir -p ~/vagrants/sigma/tmp_sigma
cd ~/vagrants/sigma/tmp_sigma
```

Then clone Sigma in order to get the Vagrant files and copy them to your host's main Sigma dir:
```
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@sigmakee.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/sigmakee checkout sigma
cp sigma/build/vagrant/bootstrap.sh ~/vagrants/sigma/
cp sigma/build/vagrant/Vagrantfile ~/vagrants/sigma/
```

And now start the Vagrant box. If you haven't downloaded the box yet, it will be fetched.

```
cd ~/vagrants/sigma/
vagrant up
```

Sigma ought to have been started on the guest box, with port forwarding from 8080 to 8888. So browse to `http://localhost:8888/sigma/login.html` to log in.
