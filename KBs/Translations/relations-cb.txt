; This file contains definitions of auxiliary predicates that help to
; define language representations of predicates defined within SUMO.
; The 'format' predicate associates a concept (either relation or
; a function) with a string. When there is a need to visualise certain
; concept in natural language, the associated string is used. The string
; generally contains a natural language description of the concept, but
; it may contain special tags which are interpreted with the browser.
; The description of these tags follows:
;
; &%token - specifies a token that will be made into a hypertext link
;    to concept (relation, function) being visualized
; %1, %2, ... - this tag will be substituted with a natural language
;    representation of the concept's respective argument; if the argument
;    is compound (not atomic, like variable or class), it is enclosed in
;    parentheses, unless the tag is postfixed with an apostrophe (like %2')
; %1a{text}, %2a{text}, ... will be replaced with text, if the respective
;    argument is atomic, or with an empty string otherwise
; %1c{text}, %2c{text}, ... will be replaced with text, if the respective
;    argument is compound, or with an empty string otherwise
; %n{text} will be replaced either with an empty string, if a predicate
;    is being rendered as positive, or 'text' otherwise; the %n tag
;    can be used as a shortcut for %n{not}
; %p{text} replaced with 'text' for positive rendering and with an
;    empty string for negative rendering
; %*{range}[delim] will be replaced with a list of natural-language
;    representation of a subset of arguments; range specifies which
;    arguments will be included - it is a comma separated list of
;    numbers or ranges; for example, range '1-4,6' denotes first,
;    second, third, fourth and sixth argument; the delim parameter
;    specifies the delimiter which will be used to separate
;    representations of arguments; both {range} and [delim] may be omited
;    - range defaults to all arguments, and delim defaults to a single
;    space
; %% will be replaced with a single percent character
