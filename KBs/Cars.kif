(documentation InternalCombustionEngine EnglishLanguage "The internal combustion 
engine is an engine in which the combustion of a fuel (normally a fossil fuel) 
occurs with an oxidizer (usually air) in a combustion chamber. In an internal 
combustion engine, the expansion of the high-temperature and high -pressure 
gases produced by combustion apply direct force to some component of the engine. 
This force is applied typically to pistons, turbine blades, or a nozzle. This 
force moves the component over a distance, transforming chemical energy into 
useful mechanical energy. 
  The term internal combustion engine usually refers to an engine in which 
combustion is intermittent, such as the more familiar four-stroke and two-stroke 
piston engines, along with variants, such as the six-stroke piston engine and 
the Wankel rotary engine. A second class of internal combustion engines use 
continuous combustion: gas turbines, jet engines and most rocket engines, each 
of which are internal combustion engines on the same principle as previously 
described.
  The internal combustion engine (or ICE) is quite different from external 
combustion engines, such as steam or Stirling engines, in which the energy is 
delivered to a working fluid not consisting of, mixed with, or contaminated by 
combustion products. [from Wikipedia]")

reversed and force is transferred from the crankshaft to the 
piston for the purpose of compressing or ejecting the fluid in the

of to what degree a system is free to oscillate or not.  In an overdamped system ?NUM 
is greater than 1. The system returns (exponentially decays) to equilibrium without 
oscillating. Larger values of the damping ratio signify a return to equilibrium more slowly.
In a critically damped ?NUM equals 1. The system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible 
without oscillating. This is often desired for the damping of systems such as doors.
In an underdamped system 0 < ?NUM < 1. The system oscillates (at reduced frequency compared 
to the undamped case) with the amplitude gradually decreasing to zero.  Finally, in an
undamped system ?NUM is 0. The system oscillates at its natural &%resonantFrequency.
