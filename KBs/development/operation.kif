(documentation OperationPlan "Any plan, except for the Single
Integrated Operational Plan, for the conduct of military
operations. Plans are prepared by combatant commanders in response to
requirements established by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and by commanders of subordinate commands in response to requirements
tasked by the establishing unified commander. Operation plans are
prepared in either a complete format (OPLAN) or as a concept plan
(CONPLAN). The CONPLAN can be published with or without a timephased
force and deployment data (TPFDD) file.  (a) OPLAN --- An operation
plan for the conduct of joint operations that can be used as a basis
for development of an operation order (OPORD). An OPLAN identifies the
forces and supplies required to execute the combatant commander's
strategic concept and a movement schedule of these resources to the
theater of operations. The forces and supplies are identified in TPFDD
files. OPLANs will include all phases of the tasked operation. The
plan is prepared with the appropriate annexes, appendixes, and TPFDD
files as described in the Joint Operation Planning and Execution
System manuals containing planning policies, procedures, and
formats. Also called OPLAN. (b) CONPLAN --- An operation plan in an
abbreviated format that would require considerable expansion or
alteration to convert it into an OPLAN or OPORD. A CONPLAN contains
the combatant commander's strategic concept and those annexes and
appendixes deemed necessary by the combatant commander to complete
planning. Generally, detailed support requirements are not calculated
and TPFDD files are not prepared.  (c) CONPLAN with TPFDD --- A
CONPLAN with TPFDD is the same as a CONPLAN except that it requires
more detailed planning for phased deployment of forces. Also called
CONPLAN.")
