portion of the USMC infantry battalion, tasked with providing
supporting fire for the three rifle companies that make up the balance

gun support.
The company is often organized into four distinct elements: company
headquarters, mortar platoon (utilizing 81 mm mortars), antiarmor
platoon (utilizing either the dragon or javelin weapons system, SMAW
bunker busters, and the TOW missileweapons system), and a heavy
machine gun platoon (utilizing the M2 Browning .50 Cal and Mk19 mod3
40 mm automatic grenade launcher).
Often the TOW gunners are pulled from the antiarmor platoon and
combined with the heavy machine gun platoon to form a Combined
Anti-Armor Team (CAAT). These CAATs are mobile with humvees and are
organized into three squads with five vehicles each; the squad
organization being three vehicles with machine guns (both M2 & Mk. 19)
and two vehicles with the TOW IIb.
The remaining antiarmor unit is often trained as an ad-hoc assault and
demolitions unit furthering the organic capabilities of the battalion
commander.
The 81 mm mortar platoon also gives the battalion a heavier organic
artillery, as it supplements the 60 mm mortars found in the rifle
company weapons platoons. Company commanders can utilize 81's in half
