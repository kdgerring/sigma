(subclass ChainGun HeavyMachineGun)

(documentation ChainGun "A chain gun is a type of machine gun or
automatic cannon that uses an external source of power, rather than
recoil, to cycle the weapon, and does so via a continuous loop of
chain similar to that used on a motor or bicycle. "Chain gun" is a
registered trademark of McDonnell Douglas for a chain-powered weapon.
The primary advantages of chain-driven weapons over their
recoil-actuated counterparts are their reliability and
controllability.
Rather than being dependent upon recoil to actuate the system, which
is usually derived from the detonation of a cartridge and is thus
inherently uncontrollable, a chain gun instead depends on an external
motor to produce power. The motor drives the chain, the chain moves in
a rectangular loop via four sprockets which tension it, and one link
of the chain is in turn connected to the bolt assembly; thus the bolt
moves back and forth to load, fire, extract and eject cartridges. As
with other externally-powered guns, this provides a degree of
reliability. In addition, and again as with all externally-controlled
guns, a misfired round does not stop the weapon - it is simply
ejected.
The speed of the motor also controls how fast the weapon fires, and
thus provides controllability. During each full cycle of the chain
link attached to the bolt assembly, two periods (passage along the
'long' sides of the rectangle') control the time taken for the bolt to
drive forward and chamber a round and how quickly it extracts it,
whilst the other two periods - when the chain moves across the 'short'
sides of the rectangle, sideways relative to the axis of the barrel -
determine for how long the breech remains locked (during firing) and
open (allowing extraction and ventilation of fumes etc). Since it is
the time taken for the chain to move around a complete loop of the
rectangle that controls the rate of fire of the gun, chain guns can
theoretically operate at an infinite number of firing rates from
single shot to the maximum imposed by mechanical etc tolerances. In
practice, chain guns come with two or three pre-set firing
speeds. (from Wikipedia)")

(documentation M240 "The M240 is a belt-fed 7.62 mm NATO medium
machine gun. It has been used by the U.S. Armed Forces since the end
of the 20th century, and is also used by other NATO forces. It is used
extensively in the infantry as well as on vehicles and
aircraft. Though not the lightest medium machine gun, it is highly
regarded for reliability, and the firearm's standardization with those

smaller-caliber weapons continue to be used up to the present.
A classic example of a rifle-caliber heavy machine gun would be a
water-cooled Maxim machine gun that was belt fed, had a water jacket,
was crew served, and mounted on tripod or wheeled mount. Other types
used linkable strips (such as the Hotchkiss) or large magazines. A
common example of a heavy-caliber machine gun would be the Browning M2

(documentation MK19 "The MK19 (also known as MK-19, M19, Mark 19, or
Mk 19) is a belt-fed grenade machine gun capable of firing five
grenades per second.
The Mk 19 fires 40mm grenades at a cyclic rate of 300 to 400 rounds
per minute, giving a practical rate of fire of 60 rpm (rapid) and 40
rpm (sustained). The weapon operates on the blowback principle, which
uses the chamber pressure from each fired round to load and re-cock
the weapon. The Mk 19 is able to lob its grenade at a maximum distance
of 2.2km, though its effective range is about 1.6km. The nearest safe
distance to launch the grenade is 75 meters. In addition, the Mk 19's
flash suppressor and its lack of smoke during firing makes it
difficult for enemies to spot and counter it. For night operation, an
AN/TVS-5 night vision sight can be fitted.
The Mk 19 is a man-portable crew-served weapon that can fire from a
tripod mounted position or from a vehicle mount (this being the
preferred method as the weapon alone weighs 33 kg). The primary
ammunition for Mk 19 is the high explosive dual-purpose M430
grenade. Upon impact, the grenade can kill anyone within the radius of
five meters, and wound them within the radius of 15 meters. It can
also punch through two inches of armour, which means it can take out
most infantry fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers. It is
especially deadly when used against enemy infantry formations. The
ammunition comes in 32 or 48 round cans weighing 42 and 60 lb (20 and
30 kg). Due to its low recoil and comparatively light weight, it has
been adapted for use on many different platforms, including small
attack boats, fast attack vehicles such as the Humvee (HMMWV) and
Stryker, military jeeps and as well as a large variety of naval
mounts. (from Wikipedia)")

(subclass JavelinWeapon Missile)

(documentation JavelinWeapon "The Javelin is a manportable,
fire-and-forget antitank missile employed by dismounted infantry to
defeat current and future threat armored combat vehicles. Its range of
about 1.5 miles is more than twice that of its predecessor, the
Dragon.
The Javelin has secondary capabilities against helicopters and
ground-fighting positions. It is equipped with an imaging infrared
system and a fire-and-forget guided missile. The Javelin's normal
engagement mode is top-attack to penetrate the tank's most vulnerable
armor. It also has a direct-attack capability to engage targets with
overhead cover or in bunkers. Its "soft launch" allows employment from
within buildings and enclosed fighting positions. The soft launch
signature limits the gunner's exposure to the enemy, thus increasing
survivability.
The Javelin is credited with helping U.S. Special Forces and Kurdish
troops repel an Iraqi attack in April 2003 in one of the biggest tank
battles of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Traveling in eight trucks, the
coalition troops were met by surprise attack from an Iraqi
brigade. The Special Forces used 19 Javelins against the Iraqis, who
had 12 tanks and 24 armored personnel carriers. The shoulder-held
anti-tank weapons stopped two T-55 tanks, eight personnel carriers,
and four troop trucks even though not one of the U.S. soldiers had
ever fired the weapon before the engagement.
The Javelin consists of a missile in a disposable launch tube and a
reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) with a trigger mechanism and the
integrated day/night sighting device for surveillance, and target
acquisition and built-in test capabilities and associated
electronics. The CLU, powered by a disposable battery, provides the
capability for battlefield surveillance, target acquisition, missile
launch and damage assessment.
The round consists of a disposable launch tube assembly, battery
coolant unit, and the missile. The 3.5-foot-long missile locks on to
the target before launch using an infrared focal plane array and
on-board processing, which also maintains target track and guides the
missile to the target after launch. A full-up system weighs 49.5
pounds.
The U.S. Army awarded the Javelin contract in 1989 to Raytheon and
Lockheed Martin; the weapon was deployed some seven years later. Since
then at least nine other countries have selected the weapon for their
arsenals.
The Javelin is one of about 1,400 weapon systems supported by Defense
Supply Center Columbus, which supplies several of the missile's spare
parts to the U.S. Marine Corps through the Performance Based Logistics
arrangement. Three DSCC organizations manage these parts - the
Land-based Weapon Systems Group, the Commodity-based Application Group
and the Maritime Weapon Systems Group.

(documentation SMAWBunkerBuster "The Shoulder-launched Multipurpose
Assault Weapon (SMAW) is a versatile, lightweight and lethal weapon
system. SMAW, employed by the United States Marine Corps for more than
twenty years, has proven performance in combat situations, easily
demolishing bunkers, breaching fortifications, and defeating armored
vehicles. The man-portable SMAW is exceedingly accurate and reliable,
exhibiting an average hit probability greater than 90 percent on a 1 x
2 meter target at combat ranges.
SMAW is perfectly suited for MOUT scenarios, enabling the gunner to
defeat enemy fortifications while remaining under protective cover,
greatly enhancing survivability. SMAW will feature even greater
capability with a new Confined Space fire-from-enclosure
version. Talley Defense Systems, in cooperation with the US Marine
Corps, is perfecting a design which drastically reduces backblast and
over-pressure, and virtually eliminates flash and smoke when firing
the weapon.
The SMAW is an 83mm man-portable weapon system consisting of the MK153
Mod 0 launcher, the MK 3 Mod 0 encased HEDP rocket, the MK 6 Mod 0
encased HEAA rocket, and the MK217 Mod 0 spotting rifle cartridge. The
launcher consists of a fiberglass launch tube, a 9mm spotting rifle,
an electro-mechanical firing mechanism, open battle sights, and a
mount for the MK42 Mod 0 optical and AN/PVS-4 night sights.
The SMAW MK153 Mod 0 launcher is based on the Israeli B-300 and
consists of the launch tube, the spotting rifle, the firing mechanism,
and mounting brackets. The launch tube is fiberglass/epoxy with a gel
coat on the bore. The spotting rifle is a British design and is
mounted on the right side of the launch tube. The firing mechanism
mechanically fires the spotting rifle and uses a magneto to fire the
rocket. The mounting brackets connect the components and provide the
means for boresighting the weapon. The encased rockets are loaded at
the rear of the launcher. The spotting cartridges are stored in a
magazine in the cap of the encased rocket.
The SMAW system (launcher, ammunition and logistics support) was
fielded in 1984 as a Marine Corps unique system. At that time, the
SMAW included the MK153 Mod 0 launcher, the MK3 Mod 0 HEDP encased
rocket, the MK4 Mod 0 practice rocket and the MK217 Mod 0 9mm spotting
cartridge. The MK6 Mod 0 encased HEAA rocket is being added to the
inventory.
The MOD 0 has demonstrated several shortcomings. A series of
modifications is currently planned to address the deficiencies. They
include a resleeving process for bubbled launch tubes,
rewriting/drafting operator and technical manuals, a kit that will
reduce environmental intrusion into the trigger mechanism, and an
optical sight modification to allow the new HEAA rocket to be used
effectively against moving armor targets. Recently fielded were new
boresight bracket kits that, when installed, will solve the loss of
boresight problem between launch tube and spotting rifle.

(subclass M197GatlingGun GatlingGun)

(documentation M197GatlingGun "The M197 electric cannon is a
three-barreled electric Gatling gun developed primarily for use by
United States Army helicopter gunships.
Development of the M197 began in 1967 after experience in the Vietnam
War revealed the inadequacy of the 7.62 mm Minigun for gunship
use. The M197 is essentially a lightened version of the General
Electric M61 Vulcan cannon, with three barrels instead of six. Its
maximum rate of fire is one quarter that of the Vulcan, largely to
limit its recoil for light aircraft and helicopter use. It shares the
Vulcan's M50 and PGU series 20 mm ammunition.
The M197 went into service on later marks of the AH-1 Cobra, and was
also fitted in a ventral turret on the U.S. Marine Corps OV-10D
Bronco. It is also the basis of the GPU-2 gun pod, which incorporates
the cannon, a battery and electric drive motor, and 300 rounds of
linkless ammunition.
In the Cobra, the weapon is supplied with a magazine of 700 linked
rounds. It has a cyclic rate of fire of 730 rounds per minute (± 50
rounds). Standard practice is to fire the cannon in 100-round bursts,
allowing several minutes of cooling time between bursts.
The M197 remains in use in the latest AH-1W and AH-1Z Cobra
gunships. Although the weapon's rotary drive is theoretically quite
reliable, its ammunition feed has been anything but: Marine pilots
report an alarmingly high jam rate (sometimes greater than 30%). The
USMC and the manufacturer are aware of the problem, but no specific
fix has been incorporated on the AH-1Z. In the meantime, crews have
been trained in techniques intended to minimize the risk of
jamming. (from Wikipedia)")

successful rapid-repeating firearm. It was the first firearm to
combine reliability, high firing rate and ease of loading into a
single device. It was designed by the American inventor Richard
J. Gatling, in 1861 and patented on May 9, 1862. In modern usage it
typically refers to guns with a similar rotating barrel design.
Depending on how one defines the term, the Gatling gun is not the
first "machine gun", despite frequent references to it as such;
machine guns operate entirely on a fraction of the power of the fired
cartridge, while the Gatling relies on external power (hand crank, or
electric/hydraulic motor). (from Wikipedia)")

(subclass GuidedMissile Missile)

(documentation GuidedMissile "Missiles that have the ability to
maneuver through the air can be guided, and are known as guided
missiles. These have three key system components:
    * tracking
    * guidance
    * flight
A tracking system locates the missile's target. This can be either a
human gunner aiming a sight on the target (remotely from the missile)
or an automatic tracker. Automatic trackers use radiation emanating
from the target or emitted from the launch platform and reflecting
back to it from the target. Passive automatic trackers use the
target's inherent radiation, usually heat or light, but missiles
designed to attack Command & Control posts, aircraft or guided
missiles may look for radio waves. Active automatic trackers rely on
the target being illuminated by radiation. The target can be "painted"
with light (sometimes infrared and/or laser) or radio waves (radar)
which can be detected by the missile. The radiation for the painting
can originate in the missile itself or may come from a remote station
(for example, a hilltop gunner can illuminate a target with a laser
device and this can be used to direct an air launched guided missile).
A guidance system takes data from the missile's tracking system and
flight system and computes a flight path for the missile designed to
intercept the target. It produces commands for the flight system.
The flight system causes the missile to maneuver. There are two main
systems: vectored thrust (for missiles that are powered throughout the
guidance phase of their flight) and aerodynamic maneuvering (wings,
fins, canards, etc).
There are some similarities between guided missiles and guided
bombs. A guided bomb, dropped from an aircraft, is unpowered and uses
aerodynamic fins for forward horizontal maneuvering while falling
vertically. (from Wikipedia)")

(subclass InfraRedGMissile GuidedMissile)

(documentation InfraRedGMissile "A missile that is guided by infrared
homing. Infra-red homing refers to a guidance system which uses the
infra-red light emission from a target to track it. Missiles which use
infra-red seeking are often referred to as "heat-seekers". Infra-red
(IR) is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is
radiated strongly by hot bodies. Many objects such as people, vehicle
engines and aircraft generate and retain heat, and as such, are
especially visible in the infra-red wavelengths of light compared to
objects in the background. (from Wikipedia)")

(subclass AGM AirLaunchMissile)
(subclass AGM GroundAttackMissile)

(documentation AGM "An air-to-surface missile (also, air-to-ground
missile, ASM or AGM) is a missile designed to be launched from
military aircraft (bombers, attack aircraft, fighter aircraft or other
kinds) and strike ground targets on land, at sea, or both. They are
similar to guided glide bombs but to be considered a missile, they
usually contain some form of propulsion system. The two most common
propulsion systems for air-to-surface missiles are rocket motors and
jet engines. These also tend to correspond to the range of the
missiles - short and long, respectively. Some Soviet air-to-surface
missiles are powered by ramjets, giving them both long range and high
speed. (from Wikipedia)")

(subclass AGM65 InfraredGMissile)

(documentation AGM65 "The AGM-65 Maverick is an air-to-surface
tactical missile (ASM) designed for close air support, prohibition,
and forceful prevention. It is effective against a wide range of
tactical targets, including armor, air defenses, ships, ground
transportation, and fuel storage facilities.
The AGM-65F (infrared targeting) used by the US Navy has an infrared
guidance system optimized for ship tracking and a larger penetrating
warhead than the shaped charge used by the US Marine Corps and the US
Air Force (300 pounds (136 kg) vs 125 pounds (57 kg)). The AGM-65 has
two types of warheads; one has a contact fuze in the nose, and the
other has a heavyweight warhead with a delayed fuze, which penetrates
the target with its kinetic energy before firing. The latter is most
effective against large, hard targets. The propulsion system for both
types is a solid-fuel rocket motor behind the warhead. (from
Wikipedia)"
