;; &%before must be used with TimePoints, not TimeIntervals;
;; and (3) Axioms that apply the attributes &%Living and
;; &%Dead to &%Organism and &%HumanCorpse probably result in
;; unintended conclusions.  Consider rule [4], above, in
;; conjuction with rules [5] and [6], below, both of which

;; TO DO: 
;;
;; 1. Delete axioms [1] - [4], above, which already are

;;
;; 3. In Merge.kif, rewrite [5] to avoid concluding that
;;    Organisms can be Dead.  (already done.)
;;
;; 4. Apparently, the intent of rule [3], above, is to
;;    represent the state of most &%Dead &%Humans in a
;;    rather short time interval following death, when the
;;    body is still an intact, integral whole, and
;;    embalming, cremation, mummification, or burial have
;;    not yet occurred.  Add the section below, which tries
;;    to address the presumed intent of [1] - [4], but also
;;    tries to include human remains within a broader theory
;;    of "organism remains".

;; The distinction between "existing" as a chunk of more or
;; less organism-shaped matter and simply being Dead (having
;; experienced death), as well as the temporal aspects, make
;; this all seem excessively difficult, but alternatives
;; that make it possible to express the same distinctions of
;; meaning all seem about equally awkward.  In the approach
;; chosen here, Organism and OrganismRemains are conceived
;; as temporally disjoint.  It would be a mistake to apply
;; Dead to an instance of Organism for any time interval,
;; and a mistake to apply Living to an instance of
;; OrganismRemains for any time interval.  In other words,
;; in this approach there are no Dead Organisms, only Living
;; Organisms or Dead OrganismRemains.

;; NS: Apparently, destination is not a subrelation of
;; patient (this is good), but in the rule below ?B might
;; just as cogently be considered the patient (the object
;; acted upon/struck).  The less precise we are about the
;; distinctions between CaseRoles, the less useful SUMO will
;; be for practical applications requiring inference.

;; NS: The ambiguity of &%patient, in particular, creates
;; unnecessary confusion for axiom authors, and definitely
;; will be a problem if SUMO is ever used in an application
;; requiring serious inference.  On the one hand, &%patient
;; is frequently used to indicate the object acted on (in
;; grammatical terms, the direct object) of a Process.  On
;; the other hand, it is also used to gather up just about
;; all of the objects that play any role in a Process,
;; except for &%agent, &%origin, &%destination, and perhaps
;; a few others.  This means that a user (human or
;; application) won't really be able to determine the object
;; acted on/direct object of a Process (e.g., Process1)
;; without posing a query like the following:
;;
;;     (and
;;       (patient Process1 ?X)
;;       (not (instrument Process1 ?X))
;;       (not (resource Process1 ?X))
;;       (not (result Process1 ?X))
;;       ... etc.)
;;
;; The solution is to (a) restrict the meaning of &%patient
;; to "object acted on/direct object" and define some new
;; predicate to gather up all of the non-&%agent
;; subrelations, or (b) define some new predicate that
;; strictly means "object acted on/direct object", relate it
;; to those predicates it should subsume, and redefine
;; &%patient to mean "every case role in a Process that is
;; not the &%agent".  Either way, all of the axioms that
;; currently use &%patient and its current subrelations will
;; have to be reviewed and, if necessary, rewritten.  This
;; should be done sooner rather than later.
;;
;; To determine all of the entities that play any role in
;; Process1, a user can pose this query:
;;
;;    (involvedInEvent Process1 ?X)

;; NS: There is a tendency throughout MILO and the domain
;; ontologies, and sometimes even within Merge.kif, to
;; compose rules in relative isolation, as if no more
;; general rule already stated somewhere else could possibly
;; be relevant.  One practical result is that we allow (or
;; force) inference engines to do unnecessary skolemization.
;; Typically, an inference engine will have no way of
;; proving that two skolemized terms should be considered
;; &%equal, so newly introduced terms that "pass in the
;; night" will proliferate during inference.  Another
;; problem is the relatively small and imprecise (at least
;; as used) set of CaseRoles.  Over-skolemization and
;; CaseRole imprecision combine to pretty much guarantee
;; that many of the rules in MILO and the domain ontologies
