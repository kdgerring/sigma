;;; 0. Propositional Content of a ContentBearingProcess
;;;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Communication is a "A social interaction that involves the transfer of information between two or more cognitive agents."
;;; We need to be able to refer to the information transferred between the  cognitive agents.

;;; Communication is exhaustively partitioned into stating, supposing, directing, committing, expressing, and declaring. 
;;; All the content bearing processes subsumed by these six kinds of communication have a propositional content associated to them.

;;; Declaring is "The class of linguistic communications that effect an institutional alteration when performed by competent authority. 
;;; Some examples are nominating, marrying, and excommunicating." Any declaring has a propositional content corresponding to what was declared.
;;; (Might have to push this up to all "LinguisticCommunications", but it is certainly true for any declarings. 
;;; A declaring also has an agent who declared it, a declarator.

;;; We model it with a new CaseRole that is a subrelation of patient and takes a ContentBearingProcess and a Proposition.

(documentation propositionalContentOf EnglishLanguage "(propositionalContentOf ?PROCESS ?ENTITY) means that ?ENTITY is the propositional content of the
 ?PROCESS which is a ContentBearingProcess. For example, the propositional complement in the sentences 'The judge declared  Mary and Ed  husband and wife' 
 and 'Bill appointed Mary the new CEO of  the beer company' would be `Mary and Ed are husband and wife' and `Mary is the new CEO of the beer company'.")
