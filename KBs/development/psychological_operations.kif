(subclass PsychologicalOperation MilitaryOperation)

(documentation PsychologicalOperation "These are planned operations
that convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences
to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and
ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups,
and individuals. The purpose of PSYOP is to induce or reinforce
foreign attitudes and behaviors favorable to the JFC's
objectives. Planning and employment considerations include:

(1) Force Multiplier. PSYOP are among the most effective nonlethal
weapons available to a commander. It can reduce casualties on both
sides by reducing the morale and combat effectiveness of the
adversary, creating dissent and disaffection within their ranks,
encouraging surrenders or defections, promoting disobedience, or
inducing a lack of support for a hostile regime within a civilian
populace.

(2) Combatant Commander Responsibilities. Each geographic combatant
commander is responsible for conducting PSYOP programs in
peacetime. Such efforts are designed to create a favorable image of
the friendly government, of the United States, and of the Armed Forces
of the United States; encourage support for democratic institutions,
human rights, regional stability, and counterdrug activities; and
assist a HN in explaining and publicizing humanitarian and civic
action projects to local citizens. When used as part of an integrated
theater strategy or strategic information operation, PSYOP can reduce
the probability of conflict, reduce the damage if conflict does occur,
and speed the transition to normality in the postconflict phase.

(3) PSYOP Applications. Taking advantage of their language and culture
skills, in-depth knowledge of the region, and understanding of
interagency operations, SOF provide the geographic combatant commander
with a broad range of PSYOP capabilities to be employed independently
or in support of a larger theater campaign. These capabilities include
the following:

(a) Developing, Producing, Distributing, and Disseminating. PSYOP
units design, develop, and produce programs. They distribute and
disseminate products that support tactical, operational, and strategic
goals.

(b) Coordinating and Directing PSYOP Programs. PSYOP support national
policy goals with programs developed for and approved by higher
authority. PSYOP personnel coordinate with the chain of command to
ensure the credibility and effectiveness of the program.

(c) Producing PSYOP Studies and Estimates. PSYOP personnel produce and
maintain studies and estimates for the commander. They advise
supported commanders on the expected psychological impacts of their
courses of action (COAs). They identify the adversary PSYOP effort and
the susceptibilities of friendly forces.

(d) Support Enemy Prisoner of War (EPW), Civilian Internee (CI), and
Dislocated Civilian (DC) Operations. PSYOP support can dispel rumors,
create dialogue and pacify or indoctrinate EPWs, CIs, or DCs to
minimize violence, facilitate efficient camp operations, and ensure
safe and humane conditions persist.

(e) Providing Support to HN Assistance Operations. During CMO, PSYOP
personnel may work with CA or conventional units to promote civic
action projects either by or in support of the host government.

(f) Employ Tactical PSYOP. Tactical PSYOP forces, with augmentation,
are capable of providing all functions of PSYOP, on a limited scale,
to component commands within a designated area of operations (AO).

(4) PSYOP Support to Information Operations. PSYOP are a core
capability of IO. PSYOP activities are integrated into IO plans and
synchronized with IO objectives and themes. Mission-type orders and
decentralized execution can give PSYOP forces considerable autonomy to
conduct tactical operations within established IO guidance. For
additional information on PSYOP, see JP 3-53, Doctrine for Joint
Psychological Operations.
