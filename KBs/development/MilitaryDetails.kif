gun support.
The company is often organized into four distinct elements: company

platoon (utilizing either the dragon or javelin weapons system, SMAW
bunker busters, and the TOW missileweapons system), and a heavy
machine gun platoon (utilizing the M2 Browning .50 Cal and Mk19 mod3
40 mm automatic grenade launcher).
Often the TOW gunners are pulled from the antiarmor platoon and
combined with the heavy machine gun platoon to form a Combined
Anti-Armor Team (CAAT). These CAATs are mobile with humvees and are
organized into three squads with five vehicles each; the squad
organization being three vehicles with machine guns (both M2 & Mk. 19)
and two vehicles with the TOW IIb.
The remaining antiarmor unit is often trained as an ad-hoc assault and
demolitions unit furthering the organic capabilities of the battalion
commander.
The 81 mm mortar platoon also gives the battalion a heavier organic

short runways. Most were experiments or outright failures from the
1950s to 1970s. The Hawker-Siddeley Harrier is perhaps the most famous
production V/STOL aircraft, and the only truly operational successful
design to date. . Helicopters have continued to dominate vertical
flightV/STOL in retrospect may be one of the holy grails that has yet
to be fully fulfilled for general aircraft.
V/STOL was originally developed to allow fast jets to be operated from
clearings in forests, removing their reliance on damage-prone runways,
or operated from small aircraft carriers that would previously only
have been able to carry helicopters.
V/STOL has been replaced by STOVL or short takeoff, vertical landing
in operation, if not in design. A rolling takeoff, sometimes with a
ramp reduces the amount of thrust required to lift a fully laden
aircraft from the ground, and increases the payload and range. For
instance, the Harrier is incapable of taking off vertically with a
full weapons and fuel load, and hence is operated as STOVL wherever
possible.
The main advantages in the case of the Harrier is closer basing, which
reduces response time and tanker support requirements. In the case of
the Falklands war, it also permitted high performance fighter air
cover and ground attack without a large catapult-based aircraft
carrier. (from Wikipedia)")

all-weather, day-or-night assault transport of combat troops, supplies

forward refueling and rearming points, aeromedic evacuation of
casualties from the field, and recovery of aircraft and personnel.

The CH-46 Sea Knight was first procured in 1960 under the old
designation of HRB-1 to meet the medium-lift requirements of the
United States Marine Corps in all combat and peacetime environments
since that time. The final production version was the CH-46F. In all,
524 H-46s were produced for the Navy and Marine Corps. The last Sea
Knight rolled off the assembly line in February of 1971. The fleet is
currently being maintained until a suitable replacement is approved.

the MH-60 Seahawk. The USMC is replacing its CH-46s with the V-22
