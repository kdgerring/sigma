;; This is an annotated version of a part of the data.verb file that
;; is part of the WordNet 2.1 release.  Specifically, each record in
;; the original file now includes an extra field at the end that
;; indicates a related concept in the SUMO ontology or lower level
;; ontologies.  Each SUMO concept is designated with the prefix '&%'.
;; Note that each concept also has a suffix, '=', ':', '+', '[', ']'
;; or '@', which indicates the precise relationship between the SUMO
;; concept and the WordNet synset.  The symbols '=', '+', and '@'
;; mean, respectively, that the WordNet synset is equivalent in
;; meaning to the SUMO concept, is subsumed by the SUMO concept or is
;; an instance of the SUMO concept.  ':', '[', and ']' are the
;; complements of those relations.  For example, a mapping expressed
;; as (%ComplementFn &%Motion)+ now appears as &%Motion[ Note also
;; that ':' and ']' have not currently been needed.
