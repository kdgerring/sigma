Files in this directory are in development and are not suitable
for general use.  Several of the files define terms that
represent military content taken from the Joint Dictionary of
Military Terms.

Those interested in making use of the military content are urged
to contact Adam Pease (adampease@earthlink.net) and Jan
Scheffczyk (jan@ICSI.Berkeley.EDU).  Note that most of the files
in this directory now have "released" versions in the directory
immediately above this one.
