survival. As a result of Pashtun expansionism in the late 18th and early 
19th centuries which was fueled by Sunni prejudices against the Shi'i (thus 
attracting the help of the mostly Sunni Tajiks and Uzbeks) the Hazaras were 
driven to the barren dry mountains of central Afghanistan (the Hazarajat) 
where they live today separated into nine regionally distinct enclaves. The 
Hazaras are primarily sedentary farmers practicing some ancillary herding. 
Many Hazaras also migrated to the major towns, particularly Kabul where they 
occupied the lowest economic rungs. It is perhaps this economic deprivation 
which caused the Hazaras and other Shi'i to organize politically during the 
1960s and 1970s and concentrate on gaining political autonomy for themselves 
during the Soviet occupation. During the Soviet occupation, the Soviets 
abandoned any pretense of controlling the region. During this time, the 
Hazaras engaged in a violent civil war.")

tribal and sub-tribal groups to which they remain loyal. These tribal 
divisions have been the source of conflict among Pashtuns throughout their 
history. Even today, the Pashtun parties are divided along tribal lines. The 
majority of Pashtuns make their living off of animal husbandry and 
agriculture as well as some trade. In Afghanistan, Pashtuns have 
traditionally resided in a large semi-circular area following the Afghan 
border form north of the Darya-e-Morgab east and southward to just north of 
the 35' latitude. Enclaves of Pashtuns live scattered among other ethnic 
groups in much of the rest of the country, especially in the northern regions

their neighbors. Slender and light skinned, the Tajiks have aquiline noses

is vague, and it is possible that they were living in this area before the

'English on the Hands' (Signed English, Siglish). There are several systems

Portuguese and some Indonesian or Malay loans in Tetum Prasa. Growing in its 
role as a language of wider communication, functioning as a symbol of 
inter-ethnic solidarity in the region, predominantly in urban areas. There 
are 3 second-language varieties spoken by different people: (1) fluent Tetum 
Prasa spoken throughout the western 2/3 of Timor Lorosae, primarily by those 
who have lived in Dili for one or more years, (2) occasional Dili residents 
with significant influence from their own local mother tongues, and (3) 
people originally from Timor Lorosae who are overseas residents in Portugal or 
Australia, with higher portion of inflected Portuguese vocabulary and almost 
complete lack of Indonesian or Malay loans. There is also 'Tetum Ibadat' or 
'liturgical Tetum' which is not spoken by anyone for everyday communication, 
nor as mother tongue, with a lot of vocabulary and some grammar that is not 
understood widely. Cultural rituals and themes in Tetun are not as deeply 
rooted in Tetum Prasa. Heavy Portuguese and Mambae influence. Language of 
wider communication. Compared to Tetun: many more Portuguese loan words; does 
not inflect V-initial verb roots for person or number; uses more 
periphrastic constructions than morphological constructions (e.g., 
causatives); differences in possessive constructions and negatives.

Comments: Regional varieties coexist with the standard language; some are

Lombard are also very different (Philippe Cousson 1981, personal

so it is not possible at this time (1995) to say how different any of the

only in church. Some of the ethnic group are able to speak the dialects, some 
are losing their command of them. Many speakers go to church, where they hear 
Standard Slovene. Speakers are bilingual or trilingual in the Slovenian 
dialect (Windisch), a German regional variety (Kärntnerisch or Steierisch), or 
Standard German. Most speakers educated since 1945 speak Standard German
